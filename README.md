# Highdash

## About

- This is a personal project with the purpose of challenging my coding abilities. The idea to recreate the Lodash library functions and tests for my own personal use. I hope to become better at unit testing, code challenges, and refactoring through this project.

## Building Blocks

- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) is used mostly because that's what my current projects are on. I would like to do this again with Java when I get better at it.

- ESLint/Airbnb, Prettier[Config](https://github.com/paulolramos/eslint-prettier-airbnb-react)
