# Highdash

## About

- This is a personal project with the purpose of challenging my coding abilities. The idea is to have a web app that will visually demo all of the Lodash functions.

## Building Blocks

- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) is used mostly because that's what my current projects are on. I would like to do this again with Java when I get better at it.

- ESLint/Airbnb, Prettier[Config](https://github.com/paulolramos/eslint-prettier-airbnb-react)

## Resources

## Notes

- Arguments will be accepted through a form.
  - The form fields will need to be validated.
- Submit button to submit the form and execute the function.
- Reset button should clear the form and the displayed result (if any).
- Results from the function should be displayed.
